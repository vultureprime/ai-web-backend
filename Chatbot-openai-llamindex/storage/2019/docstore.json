Rides, Eats, Freight and Other Bets platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. ATG and Other Technology Programs is focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.\n\nRides\n\nRides refers to products that connect consumers with Rides Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Rides Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.", "start_char_idx": 12166, "end_char_idx": 14652, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55342041-a3c5-49a6-a0df-b2dfec2f0cb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "55342041-a3c5-49a6-a0df-b2dfec2f0cb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7aa5031-2384-4036-9036-b942bebb29cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "7a5ea984af78a2e9f609f8489d0a6a2e267409b6e396d4cd7d327566861d38ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f59c33e3-4d59-4d4c-be1a-3f57fb869737", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "153478ceb6f79879649078d31ccc089a05746266e4b55cd6e5a19ce4d76f88ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2efea362a1757265db19c00c7f40d4c0ecf559e36efb12f55fdf2277c9cfd49f", "text": "Rides also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.

At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nEats\n\nOur Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. We launched our Eats app over four years ago. We believe that Eats not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times. Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Rides Drivers or who do not have access to Rides-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Eats provides Restaurants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Restaurants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. In October 2019, we announced a majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.", "start_char_idx": 13621, "end_char_idx": 16195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f59c33e3-4d59-4d4c-be1a-3f57fb869737": {"__data__": {"id_": "f59c33e3-4d59-4d4c-be1a-3f57fb869737", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55342041-a3c5-49a6-a0df-b2dfec2f0cb1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "2efea362a1757265db19c00c7f40d4c0ecf559e36efb12f55fdf2277c9cfd49f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb760da0-dfe5-4893-ad6b-5e539fc03a7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce55fc98ff76d18550751a8168e8fd8d9ad4edd7d134e0e7695b3ecf37ecf075", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "153478ceb6f79879649078d31ccc089a05746266e4b55cd6e5a19ce4d76f88ff", "text": "For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand\n\nplatform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nIn March 2019, we announced the expansion of our Freight offering into Europe.", "start_char_idx": 15236, "end_char_idx": 17938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb760da0-dfe5-4893-ad6b-5e539fc03a7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb760da0-dfe5-4893-ad6b-5e539fc03a7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f59c33e3-4d59-4d4c-be1a-3f57fb869737", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "153478ceb6f79879649078d31ccc089a05746266e4b55cd6e5a19ce4d76f88ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55453dbf-54b9-412d-a01c-1af38d773ade", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4dff94ce28a99d9a906c2b248aba7e7a2dcf4a77d96e896a1eb3577bb3194e8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ce55fc98ff76d18550751a8168e8fd8d9ad4edd7d134e0e7695b3ecf37ecf075", "text": "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

Although Europe\u2019s freight market is one of the largest and most sophisticated in the world, we believe that European shippers and carriers experience many of the same pain points in their current operations as U.S. shippers and carriers.\n\nOther Bets\n\nThe Other Bets segment consists of multiple investment stage offerings. The largest investment within the segment is our New Mobility offering that refers to products that provide consumers with access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). New Mobility also includes Transit, UberWorks and our Platform Incubator group, which is responsible for innovating new services and use cases on our platform to drive long-term growth and cross-platform customer engagement.\n\nWe are investing in new modes of transportation that enable us to address a wider range of consumer use cases and represent a significant opportunity to bring additional trips onto our platform. We believe that dockless e-bikes and e-scooters address many of these use cases and will replace a portion of these vehicle trips over time, particularly in urban environments that suffer from substantial traffic during peak commuting hours.\n\nATG and Other Technology Programs\n\nThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.\n\nATG focuses on developing autonomous vehicle technologies, which we believe have the long-term potential to provide safer and more efficient rides and deliveries to consumers, as well as lower prices.", "start_char_idx": 16941, "end_char_idx": 19579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55453dbf-54b9-412d-a01c-1af38d773ade": {"__data__": {"id_": "55453dbf-54b9-412d-a01c-1af38d773ade", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb760da0-dfe5-4893-ad6b-5e539fc03a7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "ce55fc98ff76d18550751a8168e8fd8d9ad4edd7d134e0e7695b3ecf37ecf075", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07219148-1c52-4bad-acb7-f481f85fb34e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e45d2bc0dcb9538b3832a85109468cfed9e47fc2c2dd62149ef084b95d8afc0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4dff94ce28a99d9a906c2b248aba7e7a2dcf4a77d96e896a1eb3577bb3194e8a", "text": "New Mobility also includes Transit, UberWorks and our Platform Incubator group, which is responsible for innovating new services and use cases on our platform to drive long-term growth and cross-platform customer engagement.\n\nWe are investing in new modes of transportation that enable us to address a wider range of consumer use cases and represent a significant opportunity to bring additional trips onto our platform.

Along the way to a potential future autonomous vehicle world, we believe that there will be a long period of hybrid autonomy, in which autonomous vehicles will be deployed gradually against specific use cases while Drivers continue to serve most consumer demand. As we solve specific autonomous use cases, we will deploy autonomous vehicles against them. Such situations may include trips along a standard, well-mapped route in a predictable environment in good weather. In other situations, such as those that involve substantial traffic, complex routes, or unusual weather conditions, we will continue to rely on Drivers. Accordingly, we believe that we will be uniquely suited for this dynamic phase during the expected long hybrid period of co-existence of Drivers and autonomous vehicles.

The preliminary injunction was denied, but the plaintiff also seeks a permanent injunction.\n\nIf we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers in California as employees or make other changes to our business model in California.\n\nFurthermore, a plaintiff in another jurisdiction has filed, and other parties may file, similar motions for injunctive relief and if we do not prevail, we may be required to make changes to our business model in such jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe cannot predict whether Assembly Bill 5, or legislation in other jurisdictions, may lead to similar legislation being enacted elsewhere. Although we have filed a ballot initiative in California with other companies to address Assembly Bill 5, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts and the measure may not pass.\n\nOther examples of recent judicial decisions relating to Driver classification include the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom that found that Drivers are workers (rather than self-employed) and a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship.", "start_char_idx": 60832, "end_char_idx": 63393, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "436943bb-d2ce-423e-8060-eee2f3de4eaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "436943bb-d2ce-423e-8060-eee2f3de4eaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6da368b0-46c5-43eb-8c2e-a04d6dedb20c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "f6639b991c8ecda91792f3a5f479cf40c714c82c37e92a9699fc1dfb3774e70a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f14754ee-0ddd-4663-8a57-29913c8f6ea2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b61caa628b657d900e7564d4ad0f5aa03538ec8673364add0582f01cd21663d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a82c05dec7cb753c4935a3acfedcdcef7939a2c6544a8e1819ed0d4855915335", "text": "We cannot predict whether Assembly Bill 5, or legislation in other jurisdictions, may lead to similar legislation being enacted elsewhere.

To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\n\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\n\nOur platform is available in approximately 10,000 cities across\n\n69\n\ncountries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted.\n\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform.

We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all.\n\nFor example, one of our insurance providers recently announced early termination of coverage and was replaced with other insurance providers.\n\nIn addition to insurance related to our Rides products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.\n\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition.", "start_char_idx": 241844, "end_char_idx": 244648, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afacb359-fd0c-4af9-842d-138a00e4ba51": {"__data__": {"id_": "afacb359-fd0c-4af9-842d-138a00e4ba51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85fa6870-7dd4-4301-ac58-8af566757221", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "0cba4a266352bb83bbfe1d202cb5dd121797bcec096bb8e363946ef960269fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cbb6c17a-5540-4cc5-84a9-e34f249fd637", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91ea5f94f91cac71b0e064b09c7f91e1d41dda1d1f27084f16796e55431bea46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c974c3795cd683118133eaaf6183fd686db3e0be757b9cd01568c886480b7606", "text": "If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in\n\nDynamex Operations v. Superior Court\n\nin 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity. AB5 went into effect in January 2020.\n\nAB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but the new law does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. A similar ABC test was adopted more than 10 years ago in Massachusetts.\n\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of AB5 on our business.", "start_char_idx": 305481, "end_char_idx": 307612, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aebd8909-678f-4382-b937-23fd10aeb1a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "aebd8909-678f-4382-b937-23fd10aeb1a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36553bfb-8188-473c-98cd-835562e79282", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "130efa2b7f6b0efb4a9ba75dc2c2cc3d7dcb7260f4875d062f1c5ae92f91f9aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5252706-d1f7-4c32-8eff-074e7d7d44c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db3e14ac85e25b91ef59f6340d5ff49d5915d8fbe43ee551d66ac23ecb4ff5ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d902bcaba8d0d1476428101db1fb2030f21b2e5b74ef458483dc4b95f41bcc49", "text": "Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.

We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\n\nPrivately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.

The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s\n\nconsolidated financial statements\n\nin conformity with\n\nGAAP\n\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d) applied in lease accounting, fair values of investments and other financial instruments, useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets and intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes and non-income tax reserves,\n\ncertain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities,\n\ninsurance reserves, and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash is deposited with financial institutions around the world that the Company believes are of high credit quality. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. The Company's other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. The Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\"\n\npayment service providers\n\n\") to collect amounts due from end-users.

The Company records certain of its debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments. The Company evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities for impairment at each reporting period. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as the Company\u2019s ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Factors considered include: recent financial results and operating trends; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s investments; severity and length of the decline in value; and the Company\u2019s strategy and intentions for holding the investment.\n\nImpairment of the Company\u2019s debt securities is recognized in earnings when a decline in value has occurred that is deemed to be other than temporary, and the current fair value becomes the new cost basis for the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company considers its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities as short-term investments on the\n\nconsolidated balance sheets\n\n. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale debt securities are included in investments on the\n\nconsolidated balance sheets\n\nEquity Method Investments\n\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide the Company with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary financial instruments include cash equivalents,\n\nmarketable debt securities,\n\nrestricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and embedded derivatives and warrants.", "start_char_idx": 459702, "end_char_idx": 462431, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fce5667-0855-4521-b2e4-f9e571c75380": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fce5667-0855-4521-b2e4-f9e571c75380", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0e8cdc1-1848-41ba-85c2-a3b7cb310f10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "65f5b719c27b07fb87c37d91347d382ffad80ba13ac8fe77ef7ca4d0cde7162b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c12c8dba-64a7-4f46-b54a-3fa351ef085e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "bebbaf882ef5a4484d06ea63ee1ec7970fcb47cfc4a4f3f85c4e7810b5d28973", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fc05589-4877-463b-bfe2-9109fa73e29b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09e2fe3315a945fdca332e218196e69f9de3710af07d37b321997845a04d08f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "37eddb567b49b1c105021a68d3675a8b639d4a4033a3290b0a0f71c0dd40be6e", "text": "The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.

The largest investment within the segment is the Company\u2019s New Mobility offering that refers to products that provide consumers with access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.
