On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora.\n\nMobility\n\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, Transit and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem Inc.", "start_char_idx": 13507, "end_char_idx": 15936, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e626a30a-4b7d-461f-bd22-952b18a3433b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e626a30a-4b7d-461f-bd22-952b18a3433b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "72ca10d3-4692-4f79-ad24-d68ffb172449", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "de2158b81501564659f68662a8f0d37cba57d99790383415146ecfe26bb5fb0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "978b3716-3db7-4cd7-ad3d-30160617e6eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51749c659be1066846027fe4c7ae98bf5d00cde87d5df3effa189ddf184195c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e85cc7ff88132a910e1624c1286e2d540d68bcfe557f38956579b21171ccd8a0", "text": "We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms.

We launched our Delivery app over five years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2020, we received regulatory approvals to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\"Cornershop\u201d\"), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.", "start_char_idx": 16602, "end_char_idx": 19177, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e751571-f23c-42c0-99da-42c48affed94": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e751571-f23c-42c0-99da-42c48affed94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "978b3716-3db7-4cd7-ad3d-30160617e6eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "51749c659be1066846027fe4c7ae98bf5d00cde87d5df3effa189ddf184195c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e68bf6fd-19a0-43da-b711-80f38cdbb9fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e6d8cdac6609dda39b837f0af5f3d84565ccfc1b67904654838b0883250cb7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f154fcbb16c9d5011f429e47a4838fdd03928d6bfc66e7bceb5deb9135141eb9", "text": "Freight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.

We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nATG and Other Technology Programs\n\nThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.

The Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit. We unsuccessfully appealed this injunction to the California Court of Appeal, which affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling and held that we must comply with the preliminary injunction order. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.

These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so the future. In August 2019, New York City issued a regulation to limit how much time drivers providing ride-hailing services can spend cruising streets in busy areas of Manhattan without passengers. In December 2019, a New York state judge struck down this regulation, which was to come into effect in February 2020. New York City is appealing this ruling.

In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.\n\nIn December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) ruled in the Elite referral case that the peer-to-peer ridesharing service UberPOP was inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as \u201ca service in the field of transport\u201d within the meaning of applicable European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) legislation rather than an information society service. This ruling requires us to comply with national laws, rules, and regulations, if any, governing transport services in respect of the specific UberPOP product. The majority of our ridesharing products in the EU currently operate under licensing regimes where one or more of Mobility Drivers, vehicles, or we are required to register or hold licenses to provide services.

For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d). Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\n\nAntitrust\n\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We have historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. We see the results as feedback on our company culture and use them to measure our progress in improving our employees\u2019 experiences at work, identifying new goals and actions, and making adjustments as needed. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our employees and our workforce management strategy. In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020, we announced reductions in workforce of approximately 6,700 full-time employee roles.\n\nIn addition, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely. These decisions, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation.

In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020, we announced reductions in workforce of approximately 6,700 full-time employee roles.\n\nIn addition, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely. These decisions, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees.

In a 2020 global survey of Mobility Drivers, approximately 78% reported being satisfied with their experience driving with Uber.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies from country to country, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, and recently started to implement additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22, as described in more detail below.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).", "start_char_idx": 46468, "end_char_idx": 49137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93a6a589-536f-4fa3-861f-9815b255d2ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "93a6a589-536f-4fa3-861f-9815b255d2ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8a665dc-83ff-4aa8-83c3-c98469f3a56f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "a914579e010d506840b0026a6ddb8025b610709df015def0016938238ea6639e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "25f9c8e7-3a06-4110-beef-1ac6a4637775", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26f961c562468ed0216489da766be7e1ba8655a1f4b166fc94730fa5d651f353", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "176fa9b8b6c411b2a469adc2f3e4b8a83bfc4b150cb049adfff036af174ee16c", "text": "The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.

You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\n\nRisk Factor Summary\n\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our business.\n\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability.", "start_char_idx": 53009, "end_char_idx": 55757, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a16047e1-bd6c-4227-9bff-b0809c1987c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a16047e1-bd6c-4227-9bff-b0809c1987c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7e11e4f-145b-44cf-9f4c-5f2f3559f666", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "3b45ca59137969db0d11889e357d78d9e3aa25157cc756e868b90f3d125decfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2380da5c-54dc-4143-8ae2-9bcf2c3b124a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "395ff74b3e753d008cc8a3041b3d85591fa2d7453545c772448e8ff074e8fd37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e75452357565cfd793b16be1be716cd71ddf4a172c65bcb24e92f436fd09518b", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our business.\n\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.

For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, the SEC and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d and \u201c\u2014We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,\u201d below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breach that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.", "start_char_idx": 154373, "end_char_idx": 156795, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e78d960f-0851-4eb4-9933-2b81446e422f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e78d960f-0851-4eb4-9933-2b81446e422f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "430b94ac-c72e-4e49-adf3-a391160d6111", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "1c37bdfa69a24e38be10791c7628d7f2c55ab26d73c31a1cb04cf5b13cabae03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1901575e-21d0-46e5-9817-27883830ace8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2852bbcb8b9c2a82cf575def39e842a8cf4c8cb25ad70cbf234d34bfd86a043b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b0ed2ad7b3360906a531ef4a2be42b95f626c842e053c8f3e3eeea1bc2ec031c", "text": "As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire.

In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.", "start_char_idx": 239634, "end_char_idx": 242371, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ea53eff-d4fd-4a77-8ba3-ac2cf23af1b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ea53eff-d4fd-4a77-8ba3-ac2cf23af1b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "790daa33-76ff-484d-9d89-78a3e3b94094", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e5b75e223ff34b79284da98caeab8d9275fda18f2a88c55a37d9855fa9fd206d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f56328b9-7eae-405f-910e-2629a5e85b79", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f26f13af13cfa4eb666f4d7a5cff1ef51428c560346a99666ca70f594cb17a50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9cdb96f5de61f3698d980e84098a2775c0503fdfe83de80cee62e1cc5cfade93", "text": "The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making.

Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.

In addition, we and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest have been sued, and we may in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have an interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property in such lawsuits, the value of our investment may materially decline.\n\nAny intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. Further, certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.\n\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties, which may increase our operating expenses.

We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Delivery People, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees, including the California Attorney General\u2019s suit, remains pending, and we may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr.", "start_char_idx": 309705, "end_char_idx": 312433, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f15d6992-94f9-4551-afd4-912464e4843a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f15d6992-94f9-4551-afd4-912464e4843a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c404ea8e-a0a3-428d-a261-dcc54c8dee0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "a2b25e2777210742f2a904627a75eebe3a7f14eb082ed3e032b088e7df35e5cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eca189d5-49cf-471b-b62e-3edcd4f57485", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e796982e8c4029d0212648c355d5eeff256057e44efbd7e6d3a190cc2ed83cc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7193b9b830db0d744a8689f83e7bad059e307e42b4d859576813fa425b27cc9f", "text": "Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees, including the California Attorney General\u2019s suit, remains pending, and we may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costs related to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuring and related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily for severance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial. Restructuring activities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 were not material.\n\nThese activities were designed to generate an aggregate cost savings of at least $1.0 billion annually when compared to our original fourth quarter 2020 planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.", "start_char_idx": 396248, "end_char_idx": 399081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e906bdf-4b5b-4d55-bee5-28e8fb3be88a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e906bdf-4b5b-4d55-bee5-28e8fb3be88a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7432b6df-d80b-4013-9370-7523d0f43065", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "bdf4b16645805b3f3535956c2b46119a612f15282e38ec7ff05378e414f04829", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b43681d0-a754-412d-9bdb-d2855df5a9b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72d545d51ff3627ba1abd1ed355981e621e0e60f738e958b0e8fd92c632d9ea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2a361337ea808ebcc95770e750f0e5b423211ebc9ad4c3cbcb38ec41e262c0e1", "text": "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or Delivery meal delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.\n\nFurther, judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions.

Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers. Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.

These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user when earned. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to our platform.

The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired driver, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.\n\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.

These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\n\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d).

In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.

Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the ongoing impact of the Tax Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.", "start_char_idx": 415901, "end_char_idx": 418485, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76dda64a-9e27-49c2-b0e3-2361b93e11d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "76dda64a-9e27-49c2-b0e3-2361b93e11d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "049d30ab-2ff1-4a59-9a06-bd19740a4c41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "7c9c9992a074ab59d4aed93e9ebe8db62319938c8724040c1db42bac672172cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c7a7cc7-be6f-46bd-858d-1d679eaa0d02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b8ac344ee4247c7ab5372c9e3191997e836fe019c685985dbb4949ee8119e4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "58656b2562e01bc8a78ca75c6c3af573b75c6fae81dc1bf769f09eca28cc47ea", "text": "While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.

The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. As disclosed by management, the Company\u2019s insurance reserves as of December 31, 2020 were $3,466 million.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the various actuarial methods and the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. Also, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.", "start_char_idx": 438176, "end_char_idx": 441070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d836bc98-69d1-4a3a-8df5-e09687026908": {"__data__": {"id_": "d836bc98-69d1-4a3a-8df5-e09687026908", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9bd00de-7290-4a20-b137-787d10fde6c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "327e5a442827b7f0a2623847e7e84f983ca727b422a61f6efaba8f9cf935eccd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f2e725d-fe58-45d7-9e5c-3d56a4122bbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ecc49eab24852b122e9ab9fc67acd7946bfa4ec3971822e08a1305190407274c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "88efe3b23b5539bcf9334b7f97513fb5c19344786695bf487fc3f1325321d358", "text": "As disclosed by management, the Company\u2019s insurance reserves as of December 31, 2020 were $3,466 million.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the various actuarial methods and the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.

We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nOur primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 - Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.\n\nVariable Interest Entities\n\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements.", "start_char_idx": 489570, "end_char_idx": 492067, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8a9dbae-3d83-431f-a4d5-5d333d8e3c63": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8a9dbae-3d83-431f-a4d5-5d333d8e3c63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e708592-5268-4045-9f4d-ef3e7f2c4bcd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "890e93f3aa71876b2def8d22f2d59faf728f02641a3e9ba126f4a5190c2ff613", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bbe1db2-b7f6-4ce5-902f-00d4cc9a5208", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "750a377dfd2c68e4af1f53331a856d401d1f2ad3b9f3acec54a5802075d9026c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "32dad1430249492b2248a563aa4902e74bc41666684acf765dea59ac4547323e", "text": "The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique\n\nprimarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d) is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\n\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.

Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was applied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by $230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million, representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.", "start_char_idx": 555055, "end_char_idx": 557579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b1f6420-f6f2-4b10-a1ab-e8b9bfdb8cfc": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b1f6420-f6f2-4b10-a1ab-e8b9bfdb8cfc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f32c24b-3aaf-47ca-ae29-90e7a201805e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "0a049c85870f57803376e8592754df89dc0dc6e63cf642b904bc49608e68d541", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa5eaa03-8819-4825-ab0f-ab8579e69230", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "95b5db6c313e8dbfc98f7beacce75c08a92a6ebc46abe07b287e8cb71cca0f49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "25e277a05c947fe75b5fb1fc89101792524d7e21af3ccd8d52af2299a0b87c7e", "text": "These observed inputs were considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities.

The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companies that have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration of impairments of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit. Also, during the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges to intangible assets of $23 million, property and equipment of $47 million and other current assets of $23 million in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in our New Mobility reporting unit.\n\nIn light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value. Based on an analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors, including market valuation multiples of public companies operating in the same business and considering the significant excess of the fair value attributable to the Mobility reporting unit over its carrying value, we determined that Mobility goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe performed an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.", "start_char_idx": 579817, "end_char_idx": 582192, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8ecf01f-64e6-4169-af87-63d1ddcdb206": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8ecf01f-64e6-4169-af87-63d1ddcdb206", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9759e2d4-9d30-45c8-9072-6bcc0aab3c94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "9a047ea62ce4b1d5dd8f016b3ee54e459d0db11a16589859d17ccbc160d4620a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fafbb753-7925-4d7f-93ca-4c3bfaddfa57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8be1e1d66359cb072acf8256195ae6202e848e7816439a7bfc4777bae8712d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ac3b83a3d4fec5b161c5a2a637f88928da653cd3101c0fcadff2d8c0752c0de5", "text": "In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $9.9 billion and $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2020, the change in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in U.S. federal, state, and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from loss from operations, tax credits generated during the year, and tax rate increase in the Netherlands.\n\n132\n\nThe indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for realization of deferred tax assets including post December 31, 2017 net operating loss carryovers, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2019 and 2020, we realized approximately $979 million and $744 million, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our naked credits being used as a source of income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $697 million that begin to expire in 2031.

AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.

The notice retroactively imposed various payroll tax liabilities on us, including unemployment insurance, employment training tax, state disability insurance, and personal income tax. We have filed a petition with an administrative law judge of the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board appealing the assessment. In addition to the assessment, there is a risk of exposure for later years, although no formal assessment has been issued. This matter remains pending.\n\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber.

Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement. In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. The indemnification dispute and Levandowski\u2019s claim will proceed in the bankruptcy court. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the trade secret conviction. The ultimate resolution of the matter could result in a possible loss of up to $60 million or more (depending on interest incurred) in excess of the amount accrued.\n\nTaiwan Regulatory Fines\n\nPrior to us adjusting and re-launching our operating model in April 2017 to a model where government-approved rental companies provide transport services to Riders, Drivers in Taiwan and the local Uber entity were fined by Taiwan\u2019s Directorate General of Highways in significant numbers across Taiwan.

We are currently evaluating the assignment of fair values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed but it is not practical to disclose the preliminary purchase price allocation given the short period of time between the acquisition date and the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n155\n\nSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n\nThe table below details the activity of the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and insurance reserves (in millions):\n\nBalance at Beginning of Period Additions (1), (2) Deductions Balance at End of Period Year Ended December 31, 2018 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 28 $ 208 $ ( 202 ) $ 34 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance $ 1,074 $ 227 $ ( 7 ) $ 1,294 Insurance reserves $ 1,996 $ 1,578 $ ( 637 ) $ 2,937 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 34 $ 195 $ ( 195 ) $ 34 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance $ 1,294 $ 8,616 $ ( 55 ) $ 9,855 Insurance reserves $ 2,937 $ 1,451 $ ( 970 ) $ 3,418 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 34 $ 178 $ ( 157 ) $ 55 Deferred tax assets valuation allowance $ 9,855 $ 3,655 $ ( 100 ) $ 13,410 Insurance reserves $ 3,418 $ 950 $ ( 902 ) $ 3,466\n\n(1)\n\nAdditions to insurance reserves include $(74) million, $9 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, for changes in estimates resulting from new developments in prior period claims.", "start_char_idx": 714828, "end_char_idx": 716943, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "676b076a-67e6-4507-832c-0b21aca00830": {"__data__": {"id_": "676b076a-67e6-4507-832c-0b21aca00830", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32415331-ed1f-4468-b4e4-c4c577b7afe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b3480d3b1bd240622829e3580a3289fb6c71d2fb7c181385c08c1ba1370eed19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b97f5ab9-85ed-41e0-b295-6a94603c8ac9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "c7f37c9e7c5464aa906a842afad391d70c32b26aef0265b345a1f70ea6044876", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2aae95ae-c86b-45d7-9e1c-e1d5f4c8175c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc9bdf35c1a5a79418d9eef39bfa244a3ebcf3cf7c5c286877d552dc603f5874", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2a8729e6721c9abf052d11dfb950e8e708316fe873d9a4aac5e2017af17aa87c", "text": "(2)\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in tax rate in Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year.\n\nITEM 9.
