Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\n\nMobility\n\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.", "start_char_idx": 13252, "end_char_idx": 15813, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07e27721-3d68-43f7-984a-4b03a71d14c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "07e27721-3d68-43f7-984a-4b03a71d14c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95bdae0f-6c73-463e-a86a-53be9841e77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a6502f76062a41cd06799dc8b1ad3c9dbe94d07ee83ef23a97616d70abbc723d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cace1e48-3bde-4a01-8d0d-29f84c944cb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "6ac6c1e69b1339ba7c2795a757583ff34527869e4755243f1001e5bc32925a91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "572bb0c4-7bc6-4541-b7a0-9ba8b4607e21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fcb948d01ea4c49d7e84e333fd0f3d476a10e47e694c6d6d1407496b91195f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "91a0a9741a6d28923febb42d9a6ce9567252909aa18e101088a147926d9ba8de", "text": "Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.

We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.", "start_char_idx": 16648, "end_char_idx": 19166, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff0a780b-ecf6-46b9-8e30-0c47cbd81067": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff0a780b-ecf6-46b9-8e30-0c47cbd81067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95bdae0f-6c73-463e-a86a-53be9841e77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a6502f76062a41cd06799dc8b1ad3c9dbe94d07ee83ef23a97616d70abbc723d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "572bb0c4-7bc6-4541-b7a0-9ba8b4607e21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "1fcb948d01ea4c49d7e84e333fd0f3d476a10e47e694c6d6d1407496b91195f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37e64df9-8f58-4c07-a69e-c91815f4a6d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d8c2ed7e471e4f779da793d6bc83b6b123b9bb3632c9f289f0db32d62cbbf13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "83142288eaeb5b50ce708079a4b92db321a8b08a3bdf6cdd7ddff697930a79d8", "text": "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.\n\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.", "start_char_idx": 26526, "end_char_idx": 29311, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a87f4a24-1654-4bab-b07b-71fde2b2c025": {"__data__": {"id_": "a87f4a24-1654-4bab-b07b-71fde2b2c025", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95bdae0f-6c73-463e-a86a-53be9841e77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a6502f76062a41cd06799dc8b1ad3c9dbe94d07ee83ef23a97616d70abbc723d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76270ce2-7c65-4d65-8d61-35dffdbb7762", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "446d1ee201746609b52c748e3fdbdea4ba7514e160c3cd4c3558ea171d380450", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83dd847d-ba11-45c0-9ad2-59bdb77b1780", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9fbbdd5626296173c40f2ecdce7a38a12ab0afbfe3970af2251e56f67dfa7dbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "643e39c4d328bf2a090940d6510bf88fa74c9ff6889e5fc4673e64ce9d65ae4e", "text": "In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.

Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.\n\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\n\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services.

Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses.

We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter.

To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was created based on employee feedback.

Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business.

However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.

Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\n\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, including implementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.

Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year.

The terms of certain of our outstanding debt instruments restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions on our common stock, and we may enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends or make distributions on our capital stock. Any future determination regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\n\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nIn October 2021, we issued 18,871,636 shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cDrizly\u201d). These shares were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n\nIn October 2021, we issued 398 shares of our common stock to holders of Careem Convertible Notes who elected to convert the balance of such notes to common stock at a conversion price of $55 per share.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent\n\n49\n\ncontractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\n64\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.\n\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.

Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\nEmbedded Derivatives\n\nDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument.

If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.", "start_char_idx": 366878, "end_char_idx": 369698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5098d208-0006-40b2-898f-ee452f93afea": {"__data__": {"id_": "5098d208-0006-40b2-898f-ee452f93afea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95bdae0f-6c73-463e-a86a-53be9841e77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a6502f76062a41cd06799dc8b1ad3c9dbe94d07ee83ef23a97616d70abbc723d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec72fd0c-993a-4329-b7b7-2ce3d4be1f10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "e4e6a65d0427bf7945c9a50a6c9141c831a51e542b7ebd1088a21339a9a27d37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1976789-199c-4b30-a2d3-200339a8e672", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e97c549e66b8bbc351b63c29f70d46f6dea6abb330cce050bb699243444fc80b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bf82bd0ebc7d3d6cc68c7ec9e3b890666f9a46405d34787e263a3cbd3b0e59ea", "text": "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.

The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.

We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.

Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight\u2011line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\n\nProperty and Equipment Estimated Useful Life Land Indefinite Buildings 30 - 45 years Site improvements 5 - 15 years Leased vehicles 3 - 10 years Computer equipment 3 - 5 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 5 years Dockless e-bikes 3 years Internal-use software 2 years Leased computer equipment Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term Leasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\n\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\n\nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use.

Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable.

We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nOur primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.

Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\n\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\n\nIn 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.", "start_char_idx": 449665, "end_char_idx": 452209, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efb36f7f-14a1-4ec7-a1b8-023e0f0b832f": {"__data__": {"id_": "efb36f7f-14a1-4ec7-a1b8-023e0f0b832f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95bdae0f-6c73-463e-a86a-53be9841e77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a6502f76062a41cd06799dc8b1ad3c9dbe94d07ee83ef23a97616d70abbc723d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4239d5e-c683-4d2e-8695-6c7c51725058", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "9876d1345652c388f528ca7d1000e98eb555d0552124f6472e68273d0b264bca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b0b358d-89fc-4dcc-bcf4-09dcf086671e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "21d031f168ef48683853d99bf097ee99b2e26e9d047261116434a17bf09a4e15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3ee1468c1e86befd6d7c633f0d1c3d7e704e002193ec7a95f0680bed6f08078a", "text": "87\n\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\n\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.

A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\n\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\n\nIn 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.\n\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions.

Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive.

We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received.

The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.

As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from COVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was less than their carrying value.\n\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $13.4 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\n\nThe indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for realization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Segment adjusted EBITDA: Mobility $ 2,071 $ 1,169 $ 1,596 Delivery ( 1,372 ) ( 873 ) ( 348 ) Freight ( 217 ) ( 227 ) ( 130 ) All Other (1) ( 750 ) ( 461 ) ( 11 ) Total segment adjusted EBITDA ( 268 ) ( 392 ) 1,107 Reconciling items: Corporate G&A and Platform R&D (2), (3) ( 2,457 ) ( 2,136 ) ( 1,881 ) Depreciation and amortization ( 472 ) ( 575 ) ( 902 ) Stock-based compensation expense ( 4,596 ) ( 827 ) ( 1,168 ) Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements ( 353 ) 35 ( 526 ) Driver appreciation award ( 299 ) \u2014 \u2014 Payroll tax on IPO stock-based compensation ( 86 ) \u2014 \u2014 Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets ( 8 ) ( 317 ) ( 157 ) Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses \u2014 ( 86 ) ( 102 ) Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets \u2014 ( 102 ) ( 5 ) COVID-19 response initiatives \u2014 ( 106 ) ( 54 ) Gain on lease arrangement, net \u2014 5 \u2014 Restructuring and related charges, net ( 57 ) ( 362 ) \u2014 Legacy auto insurance transfer (4) \u2014 \u2014 ( 103 ) Mass arbitration fees \u2014 \u2014 ( 43 ) Loss from operations $ ( 8,596 ) $ ( 4,863 ) $ ( 3,834 )\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes historical results of ATG and Other Technology Programs and New Mobility.", "start_char_idx": 596133, "end_char_idx": 598594, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ccac390-c49b-4f0c-9b9c-49eb0da99e0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ccac390-c49b-4f0c-9b9c-49eb0da99e0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95bdae0f-6c73-463e-a86a-53be9841e77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "a6502f76062a41cd06799dc8b1ad3c9dbe94d07ee83ef23a97616d70abbc723d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e4fe268-30fe-454d-8ccf-d56591d6d332", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "e1ebc613a176795e513b60bac26029f501fabdf466ba3dd7eb43105a3c973c28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f557b824-f820-4dcb-9c55-4f1168666442", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8132c7479aa9427bf9077b373cd42ff645903d870a8adc9068e21eac47af843f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6f3c98de521333605240c3021fcea35f1c7da8c2a5350a8bb2ef409d816387a0", "text": "(2)\n\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense.\n\n(3)\n\nIncludes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.

In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact on our current operations. The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for this matter is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v.

However, we were not the primary beneficiary because neither the investment in CCPS Preferred Shares nor the note receivable provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zomato\u2019s economic performance.

Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIn accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc.
